# Micro Insurance for Gig Workers

## Project Description

The Micro Insurance for Gig Workers project is a decentralized blockchain-based insurance platform specifically designed to provide affordable, accessible, and transparent insurance coverage for gig economy workers. This smart contract system enables delivery drivers, rideshare operators, freelancers, and other gig workers to purchase micro-insurance policies and submit claims directly on the blockchain.

Traditional insurance models often exclude gig workers due to their irregular income patterns and non-traditional employment status. Our solution leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless, automated insurance ecosystem that serves this underserved market segment.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize insurance access for the growing gig economy workforce by creating a decentralized, transparent, and efficient micro-insurance platform. We aim to bridge the insurance gap for millions of gig workers worldwide who currently lack adequate protection against work-related risks, income loss, and unexpected events.

By utilizing smart contracts, we eliminate intermediaries, reduce costs, and ensure faster claim processing while maintaining complete transparency in policy management and claim settlements.
